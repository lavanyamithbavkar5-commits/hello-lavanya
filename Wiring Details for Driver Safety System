##  Microcontroller: Arduino Uno

| Arduino Pin | Connected Component       | Purpose / Signal Type                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `A0`        | MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor (AOUT) | Reads analog alcohol level                |
| `D2`        | IR Eye Blink Sensor (OUT)  | Reads digital eye state (HIGH = closed)   |
| `D7`        | LED (positive terminal)    | Visual alert when alcohol/drowsiness is detected |
| `D8`        | Buzzer (positive terminal) | Audio alert when alcohol/drowsiness is detected |
| `D9`        | Relay Module (IN)          | Controls engine lock (LOW = lock)         |
| `5V`        | MQ-3 VCC, IR Sensor VCC, Relay VCC, LED (via resistor), Buzzer (via resistor) | Powers all components                     |
| `GND`       | MQ-3 GND, IR Sensor GND, Relay GND, LED GND, Buzzer GND | Common ground for all components          |

##  Relay Module

| Relay Pin | Arduino Connection |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `IN`      | `D9`               |
| `VCC`     | `5V`               |
| `GND`     | `GND`              |
| `NO`      | Connected to motor positive terminal |
| `COM`     | Connected to power source |
| `NC`      | (Unused or used for normally closed logic) |

> **Note:** The relay controls the motor (engine simulation). When triggered, it disconnects the motor to simulate engine lock.
